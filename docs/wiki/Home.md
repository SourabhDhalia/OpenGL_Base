# OGLQuickstart Wiki

Welcome to the OGLQuickstart base project. This wiki explains how the template is organised and how to build the starter GLFW/GLAD app on macOS, Windows, and Linux.

## Pages
- [Getting Started](Getting-Started.md)
- [Building on macOS](Building-on-macOS.md)
- [Building on Windows](Building-on-Windows.md)
- [Building on Linux](Building-on-Linux.md)
- [Repository Hygiene](Repository-Hygiene.md)

### AI/GPT Workflows
- Use the Getting Started guide as a prompt for your assistant to automate environment setup.
- Ask GPT to generate new rendering demos or utilities, then drop the files into `src/` and extend `CMakeLists.txt`.
- Keep this docs folder mirrored in the GitHub Wiki so contributors (human or AI) can follow consistent steps across platforms.

Use these pages as-is or copy them into the GitHub wiki after pushing the repo.
